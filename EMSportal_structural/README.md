## Objectives:

* Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.
* Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.
* Use some structural design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.


## Implementation description

* Facade Pattern

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.


* Decorator Pattern 

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

* Adapter Pattern

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate

* Flyweight Pattern

Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.




## Conclusions 

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
